# rdrr.io issues

If you want to suggest a new feature or report a bug, please create an issue against this repository. **[Click here to go to the issues page.](https://github.com/rdrr-io/rdrr-issues/issues)**

I also appreciate feedback on which bugs and features are important to you, so **please leave comments/+1s/thumbs-ups** on relevant issues.

These are specifically issues for the rdrr.io *website* - how it looks, how it works, and the accuracy of the content inside it.

Please don't use these issues for tech support against individual packages. If you need help with a package, you should:

* post a comment on the package page,
* contact the package author, or
* ask a question on StackOverflow

Of course, if your issue is about how a package's documentation is displaying *on rdrr.io*, please file a bug.

When in doubt, file a bug!

Thanks!
